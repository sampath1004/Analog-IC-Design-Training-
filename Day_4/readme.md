# Day 4 – Analog Layout Design (Overview & Practical Session)

This session focused on the fundamentals of Analog IC Layout Design along with
an introductory hands-on experience using the Cadence Virtuoso Layout Editor.

## Overview of Layout Design

- Layout design is the process of converting a circuit schematic into its
  physical representation on silicon.
- A good layout is essential to achieve:
  - Reliable circuit performance
  - Accurate device matching
  - Reduced noise and interference
  - Improved long-term reliability
- An incorrect or poor layout can negatively impact circuit behavior even when
  the schematic is correct.

## Significance of Layout in Analog ICs

- Analog circuits are highly sensitive to:
  - Parasitic effects
  - Device mismatch
  - Noise coupling
- Layout quality directly affects:
  - Gain
  - Offset voltage
  - Bandwidth
  - Temperature stability
- Strict layout practices are therefore crucial in analog design.

## Layout Rules and Design Constraints

- Design Rule Check (DRC) ensures the layout complies with fabrication rules.
- Important design rules include:
  - Minimum width and spacing
  - Enclosure requirements
  - Via placement rules
- Layout Versus Schematic (LVS) verification confirms correct connectivity
  between schematic and layout.

## Analog Layout Techniques

- Matching techniques used in analog layout:
  - Common-centroid layout
  - Interdigitated layout
- Guard rings are used to protect sensitive circuits from noise.
- Dummy devices help reduce edge-related process variations.
- Symmetry is maintained for matched components.
- Routing guidelines include:
  - Short and direct interconnections
  - Avoiding sharp corners
  - Proper selection of metal layers
